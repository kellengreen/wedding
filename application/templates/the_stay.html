        <h4>House Rental</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> is a trusted San Francisco community marketplace
            where people list their homes online for rental use.
            This would be a great option for a group traveling together or a couple looking for a studio for the
            weekend!</p>

        <h4>Flights</h4>

        <p>Feel free to fly into either Oakland International Airport OR San Francisco International - they are
            both convenient into the city! You can either take <a href="http://www.bart.gov/" target="_blank">BART</a>
            (est. $10-12 per person), <a href="http://airportexpresssf.com/" target="_target">shuttle service</a> (est.
            $25 pp), cab (est. $50 ride), or Uber (est. $35 ride) into the city.</p>

        <h4>Getting Around</h4>

        <p>We would recommend not renting a car. Parking overnight in hotels or parking garages can get very
            expensive not to mention hard to find! The city is full of cabs and rideshare programs which we would
            encourage you to take advantage of.</p>

        <h4>Uber</h4>

        <p>The most efficient way of getting around the city is by using an app called Uber. By downloading Uber to your
            phone <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/uberzagwedding" target="_blank">HERE</a> you will be able to
            request a taxi, personal driver, black car, or SUV to pick you up at a specific location and drop you off
            anywhere in the city! Best part about the process is no cash is needed, you connect your credit card to
            your account and are automatically charged after you have completed your ride and if you use the link
            above or promo code: <strong>uberzagwedding</strong> you get $20 off your first ride.</p>
